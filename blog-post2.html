        <h1>Automating Proforma Invoice Generation</h1>
        
        <section class="case-section">
            <h2>1. Introduction: The Problem</h2>
            <p>Before automation, employees had to <strong>manually create proforma invoices</strong> by copying order details from the website for each client who wanted to pay via bank transfer. This process was <strong>time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to errors</strong>, slowing down order processing and increasing the risk of incorrect invoices.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="case-section">
            <h2>2. The Solution</h2>
            <p>To streamline this process, I built a <strong>Google Apps Script Web App</strong> that automates proforma invoice generation. The system works as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Employee enters an order number</strong> into a simple web interface.</li>
                <li><strong>The script fetches order details</strong> from the WooCommerce API.</li>
                <li><strong>A proforma invoice is automatically generated</strong> using a set Google Sheets template.</li>
                <li><strong>The invoice is saved as a PDF</strong> and sent to the employee for further processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Google Apps Script, WooCommerce API, JavaScript (for UI elements), Google Sheets (as a template system).</p>

            <h2>3. Results & Impact</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ <strong>Eliminated manual invoice creation</strong>, saving employees valuable time.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Reduced errors</strong>, ensuring more accurate invoices.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Simplified the process</strong>, making it accessible even for non-technical employees.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section class="case-section">
            <h2>4. Challenges & Learnings</h2>
            <p>The biggest challenge was <strong>creating the web-based UI</strong> since front-end development was a new area for me. However, I overcame this by learning and implementing simple HTML and JavaScript elements to create an easy-to-use interface for employees.</p>

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This solution transformed the invoicing workflow, making it <strong>faster, more accurate, and less frustrating</strong> for employees. With potential future improvements, such as automatic email sending of the invoices, this system can further enhance efficiency and reduce manual work.</p>
